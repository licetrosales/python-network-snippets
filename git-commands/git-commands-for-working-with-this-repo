# 📘 Git Basics: Key Commands for Common Tasks

This document explains essential Git tasks and their related commands.  
Ideal for beginners and B1-level German learners (English version).

## 1️⃣ How Git Stores Data

- `git init`  
  Initializes a Git repository. Creates the hidden `.git` folder where Git stores data.

- `git cat-file -p <hash>`  
  Shows the content of a Git object (blob, tree, or commit).

- `git log`  
  Displays the history of commits to understand change tracking.

---

## 2️⃣ How to Create Repositories

- `git init`  
  Creates a new **local** Git repository in the current directory.

- `git clone <url>`  
  Copies (clones) a **remote** repository to your machine.

---

## 3️⃣ How to Make Commits

- `git add <file>`  
  Adds the file to the staging area, preparing it for commit.

- `git commit -m "your message"`  
  Saves the staged changes with a descriptive message.

- `git status`  
  Shows the current state of the working directory and staging area.

---

## 4️⃣ How to Compare Versions

- `git diff`  
  Shows changes between working directory and last commit.

- `git diff <commit1> <commit2>`  
  Compares the differences between two commits.

- `git log`  
  Displays the list of commits (to get commit hashes).

- `git show <commit>`  
  Shows details and changes of a specific commit.

---
## 5️⃣ How to Work with Branches

- `git diff main chatbot`  
  🔍 Compares the state of the `main` and `chatbot` branches.

- `git branch`  
  📋 Lists all branches in the repository.

- `git branch -m old_name new_name`  
  ✏️ Renames a branch from `old_name` to `new_name`.

- `git branch -d chatbot`  
  🗑️ Deletes the `chatbot` branch, **if it has already been merged**.

- `git branch -D chatbot`  
  🧨 Force-deletes the `chatbot` branch, **even if it has not been merged**.

## 6️⃣ How to Synchronize with Remote Repositories

```bash
# 🔄 Fetching from a Remote
git fetch origin
# Retrieves branches and their commits from the remote named origin,
# without merging them into your current branch.

# 🔗 Merging Remote Changes
git merge origin/<branch>
# After fetching, you merge the changes into your local branch.
# This integrates updates from the remote.

# 🛠️ Pulling from a Remote
git pull origin
# Combines fetching and merging in a single step.
# Retrieves remote changes and merges them into your current branch.

# ⚠️ Handling Uncommitted Changes
# Before pulling, Git checks for uncommitted local changes.
# If any exist, Git will abort the pull and prompt you to commit or stash them first.

## 7️⃣ How to Push Changes to Remote Repositories

Keeping your content synced between local and remote repos is essential for maintaining a ground truth for your project, enabling collaboration where everyone is building from the same core contents held in the remote.

```bash
# ✅ Push changes from your local branch to a remote
git push remote local_branch

# ▶️ Push into `remote` from `local_branch`
# Example: push to the remote named "origin" from the "main" branch
git push origin main


✅ **Tip**: Use `git help <command>` to get more info about any Git command.
