## Short description
A small, public collection of Python network programming snippets (sockets, TCP, UDP, TLS, HTTP, email).  
Status: **v0.1 (initial)**
## Why this repo
- Keep short, well-documented code examples that you can reuse.
## File & snippet conventions
- Each snippet file begins with a short header comment (tags, date, difficulty).
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `tcp_echo_server.py`, `http_client_requests.py`).
## How to use
Each file is a standalone Python script. You can run any snippet like this:

```bash
python tcp_echo_server.py

## Requirements

Most snippets use only Python's standard library.
